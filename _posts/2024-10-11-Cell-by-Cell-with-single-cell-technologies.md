**Cell by Cell: Unlocking biological discoveries with Single Cell Technologies**

Over the past year, in my role as Associate Director at the HMS Single Cell Core, I have optimized and produced single cell -omics datasets for nearly a dozen emerging model organisms. As a developmental biologist, this experience has been both delightful and enlightening—providing me with valuable lessons and a unique perspective on this rapidly evolving single cell field. I foresee enormous potential for this to expand into a major area of research in the coming years. In this blog series, I aim to share these insights with a broader audience (there' a BIG picture here). In this blog, I’ll set the stage and pose key questions, and in the following one, I’ll explore potential ways (from the wet bench, bioinformatics and single cell techdev perspective) to mitigate the challenges that we, as single-cell scientists and a community, are likely to face along this journey. It's going to take a village to get this right.

**Here goes:**

Historically, the field of biology has focused on a select group of model organisms. However, with over a million species on Earth and a growing recognition of biodiversity’s importance, it’s becoming increasingly clear that non-model species must also take center stage. These unexplored organisms will harbor unique biological secrets that can reveal new insights into evolution, ecology, and disease mechanisms. In the face of the ongoing sixth mass extinction, studying a broader array of species at single cell resolution is critical to unlocking life's complexity, driving scientific breakthroughs, and advancing biodiversity conservation. Single-cell technologies are pivotal in this endeavor, allowing researchers to dissect cellular heterogeneity and uncover complex biological systems with unparalleled precision.

However, uncovering the biology of over a million species, one cell at a time, is a monumental task, presenting both significant challenges and exciting opportunities. Needless to say, it also requires forethought. This problem needs to be approached at multiple scales or resolutions, but first, we must think systematically and define which scales to address as a community and ask key questions:

1.     Where, in the animal tree, do we start?

2.     Which species should we prioritize?

3.     What types of measurements will provide the most valuable insights?

4.     How do we establish standards for sample collection, preservation, and protocol use? Many species collected in the wild may not be suitable for lab culturing, so how do we manage field collections for single-cell applications uniformly across the tree of life?

5.     How can we ensure consistent (bioinfo) data collection, processing, and interpretation, and what metrics should we measure to maintain consistency and comparability?

6.     How do we effectively handle and mine such multimodal, big data and make sense of it?

7.     How will we know when we’ve completed this effort in terms of sampling, as well as the data and cell atlases we produce?

8. What type of (monetarily sustainable) single cell techdev can allow an exercise of this scale?

Crucially, the standards we set must be flexible enough to integrate seamlessly with rapidly evolving technologies, ensuring they remain relevant and do not become quickly obsolete. Moreover, the data we produce in the future must be compatible with prior efforts, enabling researchers to merge datasets across projects and time scales for maximum impact. By prioritizing this, we can ensure that tomorrow’s discoveries build on past efforts and don’t exist in a vacuum, thus accelerating biological insight. This approach will also ensure the best use of funding, as it promotes collaboration and maximizes the utility of existing resources.

We must also carefully select pilot species that represent a broad spectrum of evolutionary diversity, ecological significance, and #biomedical relevance. In parallel, it’s essential to agree upon and define the types of single-cell measurements—microscopy, imaging, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and multiomics based—that will best capture cellular diversity across species and develop coherent protocols toward these goals. Standardizing methods and data formats across different organisms is vital to building a unified framework for discovery.

This effort will require collaboration among experts from various fields, including developmental biology, cell biology, genomics, bioinformatics, conservation biology, zoology, and single cell technology companies. Such an interdisciplinary approach not only brings together diverse expertise but also compels us to refine and deepen our understanding within each discipline. For instance, single-cell experiments on emerging models are likely to identify novel cell types, encouraging us to collaboratively first define cell types (or what to call a cell type), ways to identify orthologs and cellular homologies across species, set up bioinformatics pipelines for these, and ensure that we set robust baselines applicable across different biological contexts.

Finally, lets talk funding. It is very hard to get funding for non-model work in today's scientific climate (this is a real pity). A project on this scale is going to require dedicated sources of funding world-over, which begins with funding agencies needing to recognize the value of such work (and basic science). Plus, such a global initiative necessitates thoughtful consideration of how to include individuals from less privileged backgrounds with fewer resources. We should explore strategies from the get go, to level the playing field and promote inclusion throughout the process. This cannot be an exercise dominated by a few well-funded labs and/or PI's; democratizing this process is crucial to prevent gatekeeping and ensure equitable credit. Lowering the cost of single-cell assays will be a game changer in promoting such equity and inclusion.

This endeavor will fundamentally transform our understanding of biology as we know it today. As we embark on this monumental journey, we find ourselves at the threshold of a new era of biological discovery and innovation. It may feel intimidating, but as they say, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
